#The  controller inserts flow table entries based on switching rules
# following code emulates basic source-mac address learning,forwarding
#and filtering mechanisms found on switches
#1.keep firewall policy in place
# Th the firewall filters based on Mac addr, IP adr and TCP headers (for XMAS attacks)

#2.if the incoming packet matches the firewall rules, follow the rule
#3.if a match and drop action, insert a flow table entry to drop the packet
#4. if no match or a forward action, process the packet as per normal switching action.
# L2 controller inserts the flow table entries based on switching rules
# the following code emulates basic source-mac address learning , forwarding
# 1.switch forwards any packet with no match to the controller
#   > controller to check if (src-mac-add ,src-port-id) pair be updated in the srcmacaddr table.
#   > if dest is a multicast - flood the packet
#   > controller to check for (des-mac-add,dest-port-id) pair in its addr table
#   >a. if an entry is made, send relevant flow mod message(with a match statement) to switch with information of outgoing port.
#   >b. if no entry is made, the controller insturcts the switch to  broadcast the packet for that destnation mac addr 
#   >c. if destination port addr is same as source port addr drop the packet#   > send the ofmessage to the out.

# generic info
# all mentioned events ex:ConnectionUp and PacketIn can be found in pox/openflow/__init__.py
# all events have min of 3 attributes 1. connection 2.ofp (of packet which triggerd the event) 3.dpid
#though there is no req for controller to maintain mac addr table, since the ft on switch expires its always a good idea to have a ref on controller -- macaddrtable{}
#in v5 version, trying to accomodate multiple switches.

#DDoS , DOS attacks are made when a host or set of hosts repeatedly sends ICMP/unneccessary to specific destination server, the server renders incapbale of handling any legitimate traffic. The following module of code would check the number of packets for a given destination in a duration of 1 min or so and blocks icmp packets to the destination host for a specific amount of time.
# below replicated module is ping flood.
